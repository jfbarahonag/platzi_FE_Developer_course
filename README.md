## DOM (Document Object Model)
Transcript the HTML instructions to objects readable by the browser.

## CSSOM
Transcript the CSS instructions to objects readable by the browser.

## RENDER TREE
Is a tree integrated by the DOM & CSSOM to render in the browser the HTML & CSS instructions written by the developer.

## RENDER PROCESS (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
1. Bytes: The browser takes the code and transcript it in bytes.
2. Characters: Transcript the **bytes** in characters depending of the coding. E.g. UTF-8.
3. Tokens: Transform the **characters** in tokens, identifying the meaning of the characters relating them to tags that generate certain type of content.
4. Nodes: They are the transformation of the **tokens** in objects that the browser understand and knows how to interpret.
5. DOM: All **nodes** are ordered in a hierarchical tree where each object will have a position depending of its tag.

## BROWSER PROCESS (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
1. Process HTML and builds the DOM.
2. Process CSS and builds the CSSOM.
3. Join the trees (DOM & CSSOM) in a "big" render tree.
4. Executes the render tree and paint it.
5. Print the node to the screen (to the user).
