## DOM (Document Object Model)
Transcript the HTML instructions to objects readable by the browser.

## CSSOM
Transcript the CSS instructions to objects readable by the browser.

## RENDER TREE
Is a tree integrated by the DOM & CSSOM to render in the browser the HTML & CSS instructions written by the developer.

## RENDER PROCESS (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
1. Bytes: The browser takes the code and transcript it in bytes.
2. Characters: Transcript the **bytes** in characters depending of the coding. E.g. UTF-8.
3. Tokens: Transform the **characters** in tokens, identifying the meaning of the characters relating them to tags that generate certain type of content.
4. Nodes: They are the transformation of the **tokens** in objects that the browser understand and knows how to interpret.
5. DOM: All **nodes** are ordered in a hierarchical tree where each object will have a position depending of its tag.

## BROWSER PROCESS (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
1. Process HTML and builds the DOM.
2. Process CSS and builds the CSSOM.
3. Join the trees (DOM & CSSOM) in a "big" render tree.
4. Executes the render tree and paint it.
5. Print the node to the screen (to the user).

## Anatomy of an html element

Is composed by an *opening tag*, *content* and a *closing tag*.

```<h1> Hello world </h1>```

In the above example, we have an **h1** tag (h1 ~ h6).

### Opening tag
* Must contain  the name of the **element** enclosed between `<>`.

### Content
* Here is located the information will be shown.

### Closing tag
* Must contain  the name of the **element** enclosed between `</>`.

## Attributes
An attribute allow us to give an ID to the html element, then with the ID using CSS modify its characteristics.

The attributes always will be located in the **opening tag**

### Structure
< element attribute="value">`

E.g.:

`<h1 class="greeting">`

## Nesting
Some elements could be nested to another ones. 

In the following code, as you can see, < h1 > and < ul > are inside to the < body > element and < li > is nested to < ul >

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>List</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>TO-DO List</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Read half hour</li>
        <li>Meet with my leader</li>
        <li>Create a pull request</li>
        <li>Go to the meetup</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

## Empty elements

Some elements donÂ´t require a content  to be used, nevertheless need some special attributes to render or do something as `img` element.

``` <img src="image.png" alt="My image"> ```
